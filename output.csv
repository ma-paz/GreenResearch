Generally, constrained codes are designed to match specified channels, whereas error correction coding schemes are designed to correct the channel errors. Both play important roles to ensure the integrity of data in data storage systems. In this study, we first investigate the design of k-constrained codes combined with a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, and then we extend the idea to the design of dc-free k-constrained LDPC codes. Simulation results show that the proposed designs achieve an improved bit error rate (BER) performance, compared to prior art schemes. In particular, the proposed design for the dc-free k-constrained codes not only fully eliminates the effect of error propagation in a reverse configuration but also achieves significant dc suppression.",March 2020,IEEE Transactions on Magnetics,10.1109/TMAG.2019.2957278,2

This has resulted in huge manufacturing, usage and wastage which is eventually contributing to low energy-efficiency, more power consumption, excess carbon footprints thus leading to global warming, pollution, and other environmental issues. Keeping in mind the environmental concerns, it has become a need to impose some strict measures to minimize the cause.

This increase the difficulty in identifying the information in the presence of the noise. Noise present in all communication systems limits the performance of high-speed data communication. To compensate this higher error rate Forward Error Correction is employed where the receiver identifies the errors and corrects. Error Correction is very important to maintain a link in Communication system. Error Control Mechanism is required to achieve the acceptable error rate. Forward error correction (FEC) is such a scheme used to detect and correct the errors in the received data stream. In this scheme, error rate is controlled via Forward Transmission only. Overhead bits are added to the actual data bits. An (n, k) Linear Block Code with a specified Parity bit structure expresses a Block of ‘k’ message bits in a Block of ‘n’ Coded bits. In Systematic Linear Block code, ‘k’ information bits are followed by ‘n-k=r’ parity bits forming an ‘n’ bit Code word.

Therefore, unequal error protection (UEP) is quite often incorporated into the transmission of digital images. The so-called ""protection' is achieved via error control coding (ECC), for which the most investigated ECC class in recent years - namely, polar codes - are adopted in this work. One key issue with polar codes is code construction - determination of frozen bit-channels and information bit-channels. Moreover, for UEP, the order of the information bit-channels according to which the various bits in image pixels are to be placed needs to be determined. One specific ordering scheme is proposed in this paper and compared to an existing method. One phenomenon observed in polar decoding is that whenever there occurs an erroneously decoded bit, the succeeding bits are also likely to become erroneously decoded. In terms of visual quality, this problem translates into continous line-segments of obviously wrong lightness. To counter this problem, the technique of median filtering combined with pixel-interleaving is adopted in this work. It turns out that our scheme produces good results, in terms of the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) and the visua quality of the recovered images.",6-9 Sept. 2019,2019 4th International Conference on Intelligent Green Building and Smart Grid (IGBSG),10.1109/IGBSG.2019.8886247,0

Then, an improved version of SSC, which is referred to as fast simplified successive cancellation (FSSC) in this paper, was proposed. In this paper, some ideas in SSC and FSSC are further extended to enable even faster decoding of polar codes.

Our combination of live coding styles, as used in this study, consists of the standard live coding technique and our live secure coding demonstrations, which lead to a uniquely blended and integrated live coding approach for teaching coding along with software security concepts. To our knowledge, this is a new research study based upon a hybrid, integrated live coding approach that represents a scaffolding of distinct teaching styles, which combines coding instructions with teaching of secure coding components. We demonstrate an improvised teaching model that enhances the classical live coding pedagogy by adding the live secure coding components, which holistically represent a new variant in a traditional undergrad coding class, for an engaged and enhanced learning experience. Existing literature indicates that there is limited number of prior educational research studies on the usage of a hybrid, non-traditional live secure coding approach blended with the traditional live coding style. Thus, this paper discusses a fresh, nifty teaching strategy that involves new variants of the standard live coding instructional method and forms a hybrid pedagogical model for a more effective and relatable learning of coding skills.

Firstly, based on big data processing methods, the massive power generation data of green energy power stations are preprocessed. Secondly, considering multiple indicators such as energy consumption and output, carbon reduction effect and new energy consumption level, it is proposed to construct a carbon efficiency evaluation indicator system from the perspective of carbon. Then, the key evaluation indicators and their characteristic weights are screened out by applying Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Mathematical methods, so as to obtain the final comprehensive evaluation results and assign a graded carbon efficiency code to green energy power generation. Finally, combined with the examples, it is verified that the research method proposed in this paper can quantify the carbon efficiency level of green power generation projects, and can reflect the carbon reduction efficiency of green energy power generation projects in a more comprehensive way.",26-28 April 2024,"2024 7th International Conference on Energy, Electrical and Power Engineering (CEEPE)",10.1109/CEEPE62022.2024.10586574,0

In JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) image compression algorithm run length coding performs the actual compression by removing the redundancy from transformed and quantized image data. Using the fact that the preceding processes of run length coding, in JPEG compression algorithm, produces a large number of zeros, the original run length coding uses an ordered pair (a,b), where `a' is the length of consecutive zeros preceding the ASCII character `b'. It has been observed the occurrence of consecutive ASCII characters at the input introduce another redundancy to the encoded data, i.e. `a = 0' before each consecutive ASCII character `b'. The proposed run length encoding scheme removes the unintended redundancy by using an ordered pair only when a zero occurs and using the same EOB (End of Block) parameter at the end of each block.

Our research involves a comprehensive review of existing models and metrics used to evaluate code sustainability. Our main focus is on analyzing current tools designed to assess and grade software projects based on their environmental impact. This forward-thinking approach aims to promote eco-conscious software development practices and reduce the industry's carbon footprint. By providing developers with a tool to assess the environmental impact of their code, we hope to contribute to a more sustainable and eco-friendly software industry. Our goal is to simplify the path towards greener software, aligning the industry with global sustainability efforts.",22-23 Nov. 2023,2023 IEEE Engineering Informatics,10.1109/IEEECONF58110.2023.10520542,0

An effective approach for Green Wireless Communications is On-Demand strategy, which scales power consumption with the volume and location of user demand. Applying the On-Demand Communications model, we propose a novel scheme-Wireless Resource Trading, which characterizes the trading relationship among different wireless resources for a given number of performance metrics. According to wireless resource trading relationship, different wireless resources can be consumed for the same set of performance metrics. Therefore, to minimize the energy consumption for given performance metrics, we can trade the other type of wireless resources for the energy resource under the demanded performance metrics. Based on the wireless resource trading relationship, we derive the optimal energy-bandwidth and energy-time wireless resource trading relationship for green wireless communications. We also develop an adaptive trading strategy by using different bandwidths or different delays for different transmission distances with available bandwidths and acceptable delay bounds in wireless networks.
